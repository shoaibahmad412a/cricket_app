encouraged me to apply for a TAship, and my experience as a mentor for Stanford’s Code in Place, together with my TA experience at PIEAS, has trained me to plan carefully, explain clearly, and support diverse learners. I look forward to contributing in the classroom and lab while advancing this research at UH Mānoa.

Future Plan: Growing up in a context where many communities still face unreliable electricity and where inefficiencies persist because automation and optimization are unevenly applied has grounded my resolve to tackle infrastructure problems. This experience motivates a research agenda centered on trustworthy ML and the synergy between RL and LLMs to enable safe, interpretable decisions in grid and other critical systems. I aim to build methods and tools that reduce losses, improve resilience, and expand access, while remaining auditable to the operators who rely on them. Long term, I plan a research career in academia or industry that advances the foundations of reliable ML and translates ideas into deployable platforms for power systems automation, renewable integration and predictive diagnostics. I also hope to mentor students and collaborate across disciplines so that rigorous theory and careful engineering move forward. A PhD at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa will provide the depth in learning theory, probabilistic modeling, and systems and the collaborative environment needed to pursue this agenda with impact. I look forward to contributing my  experience at the intersection of AI and engineered systems, and commitment to clear, collaborative research to your community.
