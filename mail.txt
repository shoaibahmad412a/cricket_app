Dear Professor Hansen, 

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your research group at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Your work at the Energy Efficiency & Sustainable Energy Center and your research contributions in smart and connected energy systems, energy resilience, Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control and power system optimization deeply resonate with my research aspirations. Earlier, I was guided by Prof. Igor Molybog and was selected for PhD program to the University of Hawaii at Manoa under his supervision. Unfortunately, I was unable to continue due to the unavailability of funding (RA/TA). Nevertheless, the competitive selection and my research interactions with him have significantly strengthened my profile as a research-oriented graduate. I have also been deeply inspired by your research on power system resilience, especially your approach to modeling grid vulnerability under extreme events. The way you integrated environmental parameters into system-level analysis strongly resonates with my interest in developing smarter and more resilient energy systems. 

My research interests lie in Power System Optimization and Reinforcement Learning, Currently expanding my expertise through the CS285 Reinforcement Learning course and by implementing Grid2Op simulations using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to model intelligent grid operations under dynamic conditions. For my Final Year Project, I focused on optimizing the 177-bus Sahiwal–Gujranwala grid using Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization to reduce line losses and improve grid stability. I also developed a Smart Grid Monitoring System that integrated solar and wind energy with a smart controller for better efficiency and real-time management. In addition, I’ve applied machine learning techniques for fault detection in power systems, which deepened my interest in combining AI with energy infrastructure. Currently, I’m working as a Robotics Process Automation Engineer, where I’ve built intelligent automation solutions to boost system performance and scalability. These experiences have further strengthened my desire to explore advanced optimization and resilience strategies through a PhD.

I am excited about the opportunity to pursue my PhD under your guidance for Fall 2025 and contribute meaningfully to your ongoing research. I have attached my CV, academic transcript, and IELTS score for your review and GitHub profile to see some of the projects I’ve worked on. If you find my background aligned with your research, I’d be truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you. Would it be possible to schedule a short Zoom call at your convenience? Thank you for your time and consideration, and I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss this further.
